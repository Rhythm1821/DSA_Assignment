"""ðŸ’¡ **Q1.** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output0 [0,1]

**Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]"""

def twoSum(nums, target):
    complements = {}  # Dictionary to store complements
    
    for index, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        
        if complement in complements:
            return [complements[complement], index]
        
        complements[num] = index
    
    return []  # If no pair is found, return an empty list

print(twoSum([2,7,11,15],13))
